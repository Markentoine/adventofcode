# Advent 2017 in Elixir

This mix application is just for testing and such. If you want to run all the
solutions, run `mix run_all`. I've been developing and testing by running `iex
-S mix` and running solutions in iex by typing `Advent2017.Day<num>.p1`. You
can also run a specific day's solution w/ `mix day <num>`.

## TODO

- Refactor for speed:
  - [ ] Day 5
  - [ ] Day 13
  - [ ] Day 15
- Finish P2:
  - [ ] Day 14
  - [ ] Day 18
  - [ ] Day 20
  - [ ] Day 21
- Move Day18 + Day23 shared code into a shared class w/ composition
- Come up w/ a more correct ending solution for Day 20
